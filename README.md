# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to assess the employee information at Pewlett Hackard with emphasis on those employees about to retire. The company would like to ensure they are prepared for a "silver tsunami" as a part of their workforce will need to be replaced.
We were provided with a series of data sets that offered a comprehensive look at the employees and provided insight into the ages of these employees. Query results were used to find the number of retiring employees and the impact this will have on the company.

* A total of 50,842 retiring employees are in a senior position.
* 2 managers will be retiring.
* 1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program. 
 
## Summary
The queries show that there will be a significant number of Pewlett Hackard's employees retiring in the coming year. A large concern will be the senior positions. Of the 90,398 retiring employees, over half (50,842) are in a senior position. This loss of experience and expertise will need to be addressed. One such way would be through the mentorshp program. Unfortunately, with only 1549 employees eligible for the mentorship program, it would only replace a very tiby fraction (1.7%) of the outgoing employees.
One positive that can be seen is the amount of experienced employees who could serve as mentors to help train the upcoming employee class. This is a good indication that they will be better prepared as the newer employees are phased in.
Additonal queries may offer more insight and understanding as Pewlett Hackard begins to move forward.

The above table shows the employees eligible for the mentorship program. If it was ordered and counted in such a way that we could see what position each employee is filling, it would give a better understanding as to which departments and positions will be most impacted by the retirements.

The above table shows the salaries for Pewlett Hackard employees. If a query was run to filter this to only show retiring employees, the company could see how much their payroll would decrease. This could then go towards the recruitment and training of new employees.
